For one, while writing this, it occurred to me: “Did I spell the name of my own domain incorrectly?” I thought this as I stared at the e in imposter, wondering if I had made an egregious error. Shouldn’t it be impostor?\nNo. It couldn’t be. Could it?\nA Tale of Two Forms After questioning my sanity for a bit, I decided to research this. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that impostor dates to the 1586, while imposter dates to the 1884. Fair. The impostor variant certainly predates imposter by nearly 300 years. But nearly 150 years later, imposter is a valid version of the word.\nPerhaps the version I chose is the impostor. But nonetheless it has become a valid spelling. And therein lies an important lesson: things change.\nA young Eric would have scoffed at the idea of making an error, especially one about something that has a Latin origin. Impostor is ultimately a Latin word, after all. Why wouldn’t it follow the pattern of other words, like imperator, accusator, victor, and even actor?\nBut the pronunciation and phonetics of words are important. And English has decidedly abused Latin pronunciations. Our modern actor has the same -er sound ending as impostor (and that’s only if we are talking about American English; British English has the word sounding more like impastuh).\nReally, I made the right decision. When I went back to check, it turned out that impostorsyndro.me was already taken anyway. I will take the good fortune of a variant.\nThere’s a quote from a user on Reddit that sums up things pretty nicely (full context here):\n| Impostor seems more correct, but imposter doesn’t really seem incorrect.\nBesides, I can easily say that my name joins nicely with the -er version. That is to say, it makes a nice adjective form: imposteric. I’ll take it.\nEmbracing the Imposter There is another important lesson behind this. If you feel like an imposter, you are acknowledging your own vulnerabilities. Despite condemning yourself to an idea of “not good enough,” you are also giving yourself fertile ground for improvement. There are areas where you can continue to grow and to thrive, and this is even more important than being a stuck-up savant. Being an imposter means you are open to change. And in that openness there is opportunity. It only takes a shift of perspective to see that.\nWhen viewed in this light, the imposter’s dilemma is no longer “am I not good enough?” versus being in a particular position - a conflict of action against inaction, the fear of growing because of the feeling of failure. Instead, the imposter’s dilemma becomes a fight against indecision: “which path should I take?”\nArguably, on the surface, this is not much of a better question. Indecision can lead to stagnation, which can lead to the feelings of not being good enough, which ultimately breed a vicious cycle of imposter syndrome. But being able to fight against indecision is a powerful opportunity. There is a boundless wealth of knowledge to learn. And the amount that could possibly be learned is ever increasing. The takeaway: pick something. If you choose something and you don’t like it, you can change later. There is nothing that says the path you are on can’t change.\nAnd not only is there a wealth of knowledge to learn, there is a wealth of knowledge to create. Experience does not exist in a vacuum. All knowledge has to be built off of existing knowledge, whether as an extension of it or as an alternative to it. Heliocentrism emerged as a refute to geocentrism. There is power to explore and create. And that is the beauty of this existence. We have the opportunity to synthesize new information and new ideas. And by embracing the imposter, you embrace the potential for change.\nA Way Forward At any given moment in life, we have two options:\ndo something do nothing Perhaps this is a bit oversimplified, but we can define nothing as that which gives you no benefit to physical, mental, or emotional progression or happiness. The way of the imposter is not a way of doing nothing, because it inherently implies being in a position where one is expected to know or do something.\nLearn. Grow. Make mistakes. Learn again and change. And be the imposter.\n",
