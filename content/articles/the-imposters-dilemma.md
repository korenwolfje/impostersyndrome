This might be the tenth time I've tried creating ImposterSyndro.me. But this so far is the time that has stuck. This is the time these words actually make it to a server on the Internet.

And, yet, I am still caught up in my imposter ways. For one, while writing this, it occurred to me: "Did I spell the name of my own domain incorrectly?" I thought this as I stared at the `e` in `imposter`, wondering if I had made an egregious error. Shouldn't it be `impostor`?
